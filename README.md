# RankMySteps
### An app for counting and ranking top users based on number of steps taken

#### Introduction

This app was inspired by fitbit and jawbone like wearables that count the number of steps taken by the users and periodically send the total back to the application.
I wanted to create a list of top-n users for each day so that the users can see how far behind or ahead they are compared to other users of the app and challenge themselves.
